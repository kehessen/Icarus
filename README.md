# [Icarus](https://github.com/kehessen/Icarus/releases/latest)

A Minecraft Plugin focused on adding some fun combat mechanics.\
There is a resource pack which adds custom sounds (fow now just the lock-on sound for the turret), but the plugin will work perfectly fine without it.

### Bombs:
  - Craft 50kg, 100kg and Hydrogen Bombs to attack enemy teams in the air
  - Ammonium Nitrate and Plutonium cores can be dropped by creepers without using looting
  - Bombs can be used against enemy bases or turrets

### Turrets: 
  - craft turrets to defend against enemy bombers and other aerial attackers
  - the required ender pearl can be dropped by Endermen without using looting

### Flares:
  - can be used to distract turrets for 2.5 seconds

### Rocket Launchers:
  - Can be used to explode dropped bombs before they reach the ground
  - don't forget to craft ammo, or your team will be mad
  - (it's not a bug, it's a feature: Rocket Launchers can be used to get a quick height advantage)

### TPA and Spawn
  - Quality-of-life features such as /spawn or /tpa

### Player Mounting:
  - Mount on a player's back while they are flying to act as their gunman
  - shoot with a M2 Browning
  - don't forget to craft ammo before entering a fight

### Smoke Grenades: 
  - self-explanatory, don't rely on them too much as enemies can just disable particles!

_Many features are configurable in the config.yml file_
